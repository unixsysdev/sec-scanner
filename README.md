## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using the Live Version
1. Visit the live demo link above
2. Upload your `php_graph.json` file by dragging & dropping or clicking "Choose File"
3. Explore the interactive graph visualization
4. Use search, filters, and controls to navigate your code structure

### Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Upload a `php_graph.json` file to start exploring

### Cloudflare Worker Deployment
1. Copy `worker.js` content
2. Create a new Cloudflare Worker
3. Paste the code and deploy
4. Configure your domain's DNS to point to the worker

## 📊 Data Format

The application expects a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "unique_identifier",
      "label": "Display Name",
      "type": "class|method|function",
      "file": "path/to/file.php",
      "line": 123,
      "in_degree": 5,
      "out_degree": 3
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "node_id_1",
      "target": "node_id_2",
      "type": "extends|instantiates|static_call|method_call",
      "weight": 1
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_nodes": 1500,
    "total_edges": 3200,
    "classes": 234,
    "methods": 876,
    "functions": 390
  }
}
```

### Data Generation

The sample JSON files in this repository were generated using the included analysis scripts:

- **`php_graph.json`**: Generated by running `graph_php.py` on the AlpinResorts **odin** repository
- **`js_graph.json`**: Generated by running `graph_js.py` on the AlpinResorts **angular** repository

These scripts analyze the codebase and extract:
- Class hierarchies and inheritance relationships
- Method calls and dependencies
- Function definitions and usage
- File locations and line numbers
- Connection degrees (in/out degree analysis)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Code Architecture Review**: Understand complex codebases at a glance
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify tightly coupled components
- **Refactoring Planning**: Visualize impact of code changes
- **Documentation**: Generate visual representations of code structure
- **Onboarding**: Help new developers understand project architecture

## 🔧 Configuration

### Connection Depth
- **Depth**: How many levels of connections to show (0-5)
- **Connections per Level**: Maximum nodes to display at each level (1-10)

### Graph Controls
- **Clear**: Remove all nodes from view
- **Center**: Fit all nodes in viewport
- **Expand**: Increase spacing between nodes
- **Cluster**: Reduce spacing between nodes

## 🌟 Key Features Explained

### Smart Node Loading
- Automatically loads top 5 most connected classes on startup
- Dynamically adds connected nodes based on depth settings
- Prevents duplicate nodes and edges

### Advanced Search
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Multi-criteria search (name, ID, type)
- Filter by node type with visual indicators

### Interactive Exploration
- Click nodes to see their direct connections
- Double-click to center view on specific nodes
- Drag nodes to reorganize layout
- Hover for detailed information
